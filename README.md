## PhobiaBGone

A clientside mod using mixins to censor common phobia-triggering mobs, while still keeping said mobs in your game without needing to remove them completely, keeping the experience of these mods without needing any tweaking. The main phobias I wish to censor are Arachnophobia (Fear of Arachnids) and Entomophobia (Fear of Insects), but I am open to doing more phobias if necessary/asked to do so.

### Why?
Many people suffer from irrational phobias, some with more extreme cases than others. There currently isn't a mod (afaik) that replaces these models, but instead removes them outright, requiring some sort of tweaking to make a mod/modpack playable. I wish to create a mod that allows a person with an irrational fear to be able to play on a server or with friends who do not suffer from their fear, avoiding compromises.
