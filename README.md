## PhobiaBGone

A clientside mod using mixins to censor common phobia-triggering mobs, while still keeping said mobs in your game without needing to remove them completely, keeping the experience of these mods without needing any tweaking. The main phobias I wish to censor are Arachnophobia (Fear of Arachnids) and Entomophobia (Fear of Insects).

  - Cave Spider

### Future Supported Mods (1.12)
